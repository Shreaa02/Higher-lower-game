#Higher-Lower Game

This is a simple console-based higher-lower game where players guess if one personality/platform/organization has more or fewer followers than another.

How to Play

1)The game starts by randomly selecting two personalities/platforms/organizations.

2)The player is shown the names of two personalities/platforms/organizations whose follower counts are going to be compared.

3)The player then guesses which of the two randomly selected entries has more followers.

4)If the guess is correct, the playerâ€™s score increases, and the right guess becomes the new option one for the next question, and the game continues.

5)If the guess is incorrect, the game ends, the final score is displayed, and the user is asked if they want to continue playing.
